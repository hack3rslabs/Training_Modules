INTRODUCTION

Module 1 - Web Application Security challenges
The module is not about how the code is written securely or how the application is tested in depth.
The module speaks about the real time scenarios and challenges which are faced during managing
the application security program.

Module 2 – Advanced Web application attacks and remedy
The module explains what are all the advanced attacks which can be placed and there basic root
cause. This module also covers the best practices to mitigate the attack.

Module 3 – Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
This module speaks about how the security can be incorporated or identified in the software
engineering principles. This explains the engagement of security best practices with the water fall
model of Software design life cycle.

Module 4 – Threat modelling and Pursuit of security threats
This module is about the approach for analyzing the security of an application. It defines structured
approach that enables you to identify, quantify, and address the security risks associated with an
application

Module 5 – Web server security
The World Wide Web (WWW) is a system for exchanging information over the Internet. Web
server is the most targeted and attacked host on most organizations’ network. As a result, it is
essential to secure Web servers and the network infrastructure that supports them. This module
covers the best practices to secure a web server.

Module 6 – Secure architecture of web sites and web deployment
infrastructure
To build a secure Web application, you need an appropriate architecture and design. The cost and
effort of retrofitting security after development are too high. An architecture and design review
helps you validate the security-related design features of your application before you start the
development phase.

Module 7 – Security Auditing and fault tolerance
Most of the organizations doesn’t care about the policies and procedures unless some attacker
forces them to hire a auditor. This module speaks about some best practices and principles
regarding the security audit.

Module 8 – Code obfuscation attack scenarios
The module covers the basics of Code obfuscation techniques and related attacks and mitigations
which are spread to different platforms.

Module 9 – Memory corruption attacks and Security configurations
Components, such as libraries, frameworks, and other software modules, almost always run with
full privileges. If a vulnerable component is exploited, such an attack can facilitate serious data
loss or server takeover. Applications using components with known vulnerabilities may undermine
application defenses and enable a range of possible attacks and impacts

Module 10 – Authentication, Cryptography and Digital Signatures
Web applications frequently redirect and forward users to other pages and websites, and use
untrusted data to determine the destination pages. Without proper validation, attackers can redirect
victims to phishing or malware sites, or use forwards to access unauthorized pages

Module 11 - Web DDOS attack and its prevention

Module 12 - Mitigation of Business critical risk areas

Module 13 - Creating Fault Tolerance

Module 14 - Incident Response
